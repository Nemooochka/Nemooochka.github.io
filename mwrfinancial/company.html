                                        took a leap of faith that would define my life forever.”</p>

                                        passions,
                                        Yoni decided to enter into real estate as an international broker in the country
                                        of
                                        Panama. In
                                        less than two years, his company grew to the largest real estate brokerage in

                                        times
                                        in that

                                        persevere,
                                        that I
                                        will make it if I can just hold on and not let go. Failure was never an
                                        option.”</p>
